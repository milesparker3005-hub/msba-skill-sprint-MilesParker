I chose this topic because SQL is a language and program I know quite well so when doing independent
projects, I want to be able to use readily availble data online and leverage my SQL skills
I have already. This is good too since it is specific to Azure, which is what we use for our virtual 
desktops through the College of Business. Ultimately, I want to be able to take historical sports data
and use it to predict/discover insights I can then use during job interviews in the sport world or 
send off to recruiters.
