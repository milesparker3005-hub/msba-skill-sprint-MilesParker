In plain language, this repo demonstrates how to move data into SQL. This repo uses a customer
database as its example and uses json and csv files to import into SQL (Azure). If I were using this for a real company,
I would have to change the data to whatever data I am using, and would have to configure
the specifics of the code to tailor to exactly how I am moving the data(using json, csv, flat-files).
