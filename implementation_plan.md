In plain language, this repo demonstrates how to move data into SQL. This repo uses a customer
database as its example and uses json and csv files to import into SQL (Azure). If I were using this for a real company,
I would have to change the data to whatever data I am using, and would have to configure
the specifics of the code to tailor to exactly how I am moving the data(using json, csv, flat-files).

Since the main code I would be running is in SQL, I needed to get into the College of Business' virtual desktop environment to use Azure SQL.
However, every single time I tried getting in, I was met with the error message shown in the screenshot below. After reading the README.md from the original repository, I feel
that I have a pretty clear understanding of what this repo is doing. Running this repo would consist of me configuing SQL to make it ready for my table data to be imported.
This includes creating columns and assigning datatypes. Then, switching over to Power Shell, that is where we import the CSV. The code in this repo are templates, meaning I can save these files and use them on any data. Like I mentioned above, I would need to configure differently, but the main concepts and actions being performed are essentially the same.
